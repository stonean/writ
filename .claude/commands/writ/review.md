# /gov:review

Run a comprehensive code review against the targeted feature's implementation,
covering reuse, quality, security, efficiency, and simplicity. Produces a
`review.md` artifact alongside the spec. **Blocks the spec from reaching `done`
when MUST violations are present.**

`/gov:review` audits **code against rules**. It is complementary to `/gov:analyze`,
which audits **artifacts against each other**. Both should pass before a spec
advances to `done`.

## Inputs

- **Target** — the current `/gov:target` feature, or every feature with
  status `in-progress` or `done` when invoked with `--all`.
- **Rules** — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` and
  `framework/rules/security-frontend.md` are loaded by reference. RFC 2119
  language is authoritative: **MUST/MUST NOT** are blocking violations,
  **SHOULD/SHOULD NOT** are advisory.
- **Scope** — files referenced by the target's `plan.md` under `Affected Files`,
  plus any files modified since the spec advanced to `in-progress` (whichever
  set is larger).
- **Config** — `.govern.toml` `[review] tech-stack-verified` (boolean,
  default `false`): when `true`, the tech-stack alignment check (see
  Behavior step 1) is skipped on every run until the operator clears the
  key. Set automatically (with operator confirmation) on the first
  successful alignment check.

## Flags

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| _(none)_ | Review the current target across all dimensions |
| `--all` | Review every feature with status `in-progress` or `done`. Composes with all other flags. |
| `--security` | Run only the security pass |
| `--simplicity` | Run only the reuse / quality / efficiency / simplicity passes |
| `--quality` | Run only the correctness / bug-detection pass |
| `--fix` | Apply auto-fixable findings (see [Auto-fix scope](#auto-fix-scope) below) |
| `--since=<ref>` | Override the diff base (default: commit at which spec advanced to `in-progress`) |
| `--waive <rule-id> --reason "<text>"` | Record a waiver for a MUST violation (see [Waivers](#waivers)) |

## Pipeline position

`/gov:review` runs after `/gov:implement` has produced code and before the spec
can advance to `done`. The recommended sequence is:

```text
/gov:implement   →   /gov:review   →   /gov:analyze   →   spec status: done
```

`/gov:implement` MUST NOT mark a spec `done` while the target's `review.md`
records `must-violations: > 0`. See [Blocking semantics](#blocking-semantics).

## Behavior

For each targeted feature, in order:

### 1. Resolve target and scope

1. Resolve the working feature from `--all` or the current `/gov:target`.
   If neither yields a target, halt with `no target — run /gov:target first`.
2. Read the spec frontmatter. If `status` is not in `{in-progress, done}`,
   halt with `review only runs against in-progress or done specs`.
3. Build the file scope per [Inputs](#inputs). If the resolved scope is
   empty (no implementation files yet), write a `review.md` recording 0
   findings across all five passes, `blocking: false`, and exit `0` — there
   is nothing to review yet. Skip steps 4–5 and the rest of this run.
4. **Tech-stack alignment check.**
   - Read `.govern.toml`. If `[review] tech-stack-verified = true`, skip to
     step 5.
   - Otherwise, read `AGENTS.md`'s `Tech Stack` section and inspect the file
     scope (extensions, imports, runtime/manifest markers). Confirm the
     documented stack appears consistent with the implementation. A
     missing or empty `Tech Stack` section, or an inconsistency between
     documentation and code, halts the run with the
     [tech-stack-misalignment](#blocking-message) message and exits `1`.
   - On a successful check, prompt the operator once: _"Tech-stack
     alignment confirmed. Persist this so future runs skip the check?
     (Y/n)"_. On `Y`, write `[review] tech-stack-verified = true` to
     `.govern.toml`. On `n` or skip, the check runs again on the next
     invocation. To re-run the check after a stack change, the operator
     removes the line manually — `/gov:review` does not auto-reset.
5. Select rule files per the (now-verified) tech stack: load
   `security-backend.md` for backend stacks, `security-frontend.md` for
   frontend, and both for full-stack projects.

### 2. Load rules

Load these files inline as the authoritative review criteria:

- `framework/rules/security-backend.md` (if backend stack present)
- `framework/rules/security-frontend.md` (if frontend stack present)
- Any other `framework/rules/*.md` referenced from `AGENTS.md`
- `AGENTS.md` `Code Style`, `Testing`, `Gotchas`, and `Boundaries` sections
- The target spec's acceptance criteria and any `scenarios/*.md` files

These are the **only** sources of normative rules for the review. Do not
introduce review criteria from outside the project.

### 3. Run review passes

Run the five passes below. When a flag restricts dimensions (`--security`,
`--simplicity`, `--quality`), skip the unselected passes and record them as
`skipped` in the report.

When the same finding (matching rule ID, file, and overlapping line range)
is produced by more than one pass, retain only the highest-severity instance
in `must-violations` and `should-violations`; lower-severity duplicates are
dropped from the counts and the report. Pass-of-record for the surviving
finding is the highest-severity pass that flagged it.

#### Security pass

Walk every file in scope against the loaded security rules. For each finding,
record: rule ID, severity (MUST or SHOULD), file path, line range, the rule
text, and a one-sentence explanation of how the code violates it. **Do not
flag patterns that are not in the loaded rules** — the project's rule set is
authoritative.

#### Reuse pass

Identify logic that duplicates existing utilities or that should be extracted
into shared code. Cross-reference with `specs/system.md` for established
patterns and shared infrastructure. Severity is SHOULD unless the duplication
contradicts an explicit MUST in `AGENTS.md` `Boundaries`.

#### Quality pass

Detect bugs, missing error handling, unhandled edge cases, off-by-one errors,
and contract violations against `specs/errors.md`. Each finding includes a
confidence score 0–100. Findings below 80 confidence are recorded as
`low-confidence` and excluded from the blocking count.

#### Efficiency pass

Flag N+1 queries, repeated work, unbounded loops over user-controlled input,
and other performance issues. Severity is SHOULD by default; promote to MUST
when the inefficiency is also a security concern (e.g. unbounded input is a
DoS vector covered by the security rules).

#### Simplicity pass

Identify overengineering: premature abstraction, unnecessary indirection,
configuration that could be a constant, branches that are dead under the
current spec. Severity is SHOULD. If a simpler form is mechanically derivable,
mark the finding `auto-fixable`.

### 4. Write `review.md`

Write the report to `specs/NNN-feature/review.md` (or
`specs/NNN-feature/scenarios/SLUG/review.md` when the target is a scenario).

```markdown
---
spec: 042-example-feature
reviewed-at: 2026-05-10T14:32:00Z
reviewed-against: <sha-of-HEAD>
diff-base: <sha-where-status-became-in-progress>
must-violations: 0
should-violations: 3
low-confidence: 2
skipped-passes: []
---

# Review — 042-example-feature

## Summary

<one paragraph: overall posture, count by severity, blocking status>

## MUST violations (blocking)

<empty section when none; otherwise one heading per finding>

## SHOULD violations (advisory)

## Low-confidence findings

## Waived findings

## Skipped passes

<empty when none>
```

Each finding follows this shape:

```markdown
### MUST: <rule-id> — <one-line summary>

- **File**: `path/to/file.ts:42-55`
- **Rule**: <verbatim rule text from framework/rules/...>
- **Finding**: <one to three sentences>
- **Auto-fixable**: yes | no
- **Suggested fix**: <code block or prose>
```

The report is regenerated on every `/gov:review` run — never appended.
Findings the user has explicitly waived (see [Waivers](#waivers)) carry across
runs as long as their anchor (rule + file) is still valid.

### 5. Apply `--fix` (optional)

When `--fix` is set, after writing the report:

1. Apply every finding marked `auto-fixable: yes` whose severity is SHOULD,
   plus MUST findings whose suggested fix is purely mechanical (e.g. removing
   a hardcoded secret, adding a missing CSRF token attribute).
2. **Never** auto-apply fixes that alter externally observable behavior, change
   error messages or status codes, or modify schema. These require a manual pass.
3. Re-run only the affected passes against the modified files. Update
   `review.md` with the post-fix counts.
4. Stage the modified files but do not commit. The user owns the commit.

### 6. Update spec frontmatter

After writing the report, update the target spec's frontmatter:

```yaml
review:
  last-run: 2026-05-10T14:32:00Z
  reviewed-against: <sha>
  must-violations: 0
  should-violations: 3
  blocking: false
```

`blocking: true` when `must-violations > 0`. This is the field other commands
read.

## Blocking semantics

A spec MUST NOT advance from `in-progress` to `done` while its frontmatter
records `review.blocking: true`. This is enforced as follows:

1. **`/gov:implement`** — before marking `status: done`, reads
   `review.blocking`. If `true` (or `review.last-run` is missing), halts with:

   ```text
   blocked: spec has N MUST violation(s) — see specs/NNN-feature/review.md
   resolve the violations and re-run /gov:review, or waive with /gov:review --waive
   ```

2. **`/gov:analyze`** — adds a check to its existing audit: if the spec's
   status is `done` but `review.blocking` is `true` or `review.last-run` is
   missing, this is a validation failure. Composable with `--fix`:
   `/gov:analyze --fix` reverts `done` → `in-progress` and emits a notice
   (it never silently downgrades; the notice is the point).

3. **CI hook** — the shipped GHA template at
   `framework/templates/ci/adopter-generators.yml` fails when any
   spec at `status: done` has `review.blocking: true` or missing
   `review.last-run`.

This implements the constitution's quality gate via three mutually reinforcing
mechanisms rather than relying on any single one — consistent with the
**Design Principles** rule: never depend on human diligence.

## Blocking message

Emitted by `/gov:review` when tech-stack alignment fails (missing/empty
`AGENTS.md` `Tech Stack` section, or documented stack inconsistent with
implementation):

```text
blocked: tech-stack alignment failed — AGENTS.md Tech Stack {missing | inconsistent with code in scope}

  expected: <stack inferred from scope, e.g., "TypeScript + React frontend">
  documented: <AGENTS.md Tech Stack contents, or "(empty)">

reconcile AGENTS.md Tech Stack with the implementation, then re-run /gov:review.
to skip this check on future runs after manual reconciliation, add
[review] tech-stack-verified = true to .govern.toml.
```

## Waivers

A MUST violation can be waived only with explicit, recorded justification:

```text
/gov:review --waive <rule-id> --reason "<text>"
```

This appends to the target spec's frontmatter:

```yaml
review:
  waivers:
    - rule: SEC-BE-014
      file: src/api/internal.ts
      reason: "Endpoint is internal-only behind mTLS; rule applies to public APIs"
      waived-at: 2026-05-10T14:40:00Z
      waived-by: <git config user.email>
```

Waived findings drop out of `must-violations` count and into a separate
`waived-violations` count. They appear in `review.md` under the **Waived
findings** section. They survive across `/gov:review` runs as long as the
rule ID and file location still match; if either changes, the waiver expires
and the finding re-blocks. Line numbers are not part of the waiver anchor —
the contract is `(rule, file)`, so code moving within the file does not
expire the waiver.

### Per-run waiver processing

At the start of every `/gov:review` run, before counting findings into
`must-violations`, walk `review.waivers` and process each entry:

1. **Apply** when the file exists at the anchored path AND the rule still
   fires there. The finding appears under **Waived findings** in
   `review.md` with the waiver's `reason`; it is excluded from
   `must-violations`.
2. **Expire** when either the file no longer exists at the anchored path
   (renamed, deleted, moved) or the rule no longer fires there (offending
   code fixed, rule removed, rule renamed — IDs are permanent per
   `specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md`, so a renamed rule is a
   different rule). On expiry, drop the entry from `review.waivers` on the
   next frontmatter write AND emit one line on stdout:

   ```text
   waiver expired: rule {rule-id} at {file} ({reason})
   ```

   The notice is the point of the action; expiry MUST NOT be silent. When
   the same rule still fires anywhere in scope after a drop, the finding
   re-counts toward `must-violations` and `review.blocking` flips to
   `true` if it was previously `false`.
3. **Do not extend** a waiver to a different file. If the same rule fires
   at a path other than the waiver's anchor, that is a separate finding;
   the operator records a fresh `--waive` if it is also intentional.

### Malformed and duplicate waivers

- A waiver entry missing any of `rule`, `file`, `reason`, `waived-at`, or
  `waived-by` is **skipped** with a one-line warning naming the offending
  entry (e.g. `malformed waiver at review.waivers[2]: missing 'reason'`).
  The entry is NOT auto-removed; the operator must clean it up to silence
  the warning. Malformed entries are operator-authored state, not garbage
  for the framework to collect.
- Two or more waivers for the same `(rule, file)` pair: **only the first
  applies**. Each duplicate emits a one-line warning
  (`duplicate waiver: rule {rule-id} at {file} — entry [N] ignored`) and is
  NOT auto-pruned. Same reasoning: the framework treats duplicates as
  operator state worth investigating, not silent state to clean up.

The `review.waivers` list follows the §text-first-artifacts open-schema
rule. Adopters MAY add fields (e.g., `co-waived-by`, `approved-by-team`,
`ticket`) to enforce org-specific waiver policy in their own CI; `/gov:review`
and `/gov:analyze` will not error on unknown fields.

## Auto-fix scope

`--fix` is conservative by design. It applies fixes when **all** of these hold:

- The finding is marked `auto-fixable: yes`
- The fix does not change function signatures, return types, or schema
- The fix does not change observable HTTP status codes, error messages, or
  log formats
- The fix does not delete tests
- The fix is contained to files already in the review scope

When in doubt, leave the finding unfixed and let the user apply the
`Suggested fix` manually.

## Output

Stdout summary (always), followed by the path to `review.md`:

```text
/gov:review — 042-example-feature

  security    ✓ 0 MUST   2 SHOULD
  reuse       ✓ 0 MUST   1 SHOULD
  quality     ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD   (2 low-confidence)
  efficiency  ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD
  simplicity  ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD

  blocking: no
  report:   specs/042-example-feature/review.md
```

When MUST violations are present:

```text
/gov:review — 042-example-feature

  security    ✗ 2 MUST   1 SHOULD
  reuse       ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD
  quality     ✗ 1 MUST   0 SHOULD
  efficiency  ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD
  simplicity  ✓ 0 MUST   0 SHOULD

  blocking: yes — 3 MUST violations
  report:   specs/042-example-feature/review.md

  spec cannot advance to done. Resolve violations and re-run /gov:review,
  or run /gov:review --waive <rule-id> --reason "..." for each waivable finding.
```

Exit code: `0` when not blocking, `1` when blocking. Allows CI to gate on the
exit code without parsing the report.

## Idempotency

Re-running `/gov:review` against an unchanged target reproduces an identical
`review.md` (modulo `reviewed-at` and `reviewed-against`). This is a
derive-don't-ask invariant: review output is a function of code + rules,
never of session state.

## Notes for adopters

- Projects that customize `framework/rules/security-{backend,frontend}.md`
  pin them in `.govern.toml` `[pinned] files` to prevent `/govern` from
  overwriting their additions. `/gov:review` reads whatever is on disk —
  pinned or not.
- Projects on a stack not covered by the shipped rule files should add
  their own at `framework/rules/<domain>.md` and reference them from
  `AGENTS.md`. `/gov:review` automatically loads anything in
  `framework/rules/` that's referenced from `AGENTS.md`.
- The five-dimension model is fixed. Domain-specific concerns (accessibility,
  i18n, licensing) belong in additional rule files, not new passes.
