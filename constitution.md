# Constitution

The governing rules for spec-driven software development. This document defines the principles, workflow, and quality gates that apply to every project regardless of tech stack.

<!-- §principles -->

## Guiding Principles

These are evaluation criteria, not implementation instructions. Use them to identify gaps or violations, not to drive design decisions.

### Technology

- **Secure:** protect sensitive data through industry standards and best practices. See `specs/security-backend.md` and `specs/security-frontend.md` for enforceable rules.
- **Scalable:** design and implement to be dynamically scaled
- **Learnable:** fast onboarding through clear patterns, documentation, and accessible codebase design
- **Reliable:** graceful degradation and automatic recovery when components fail
- **Recordable:** accurate, durable data capture for business metrics, audit trails, and event tracing
- **Supportable:** simple and quick to detect, identify, and resolve issues
- **Automated:** humans only do what computers can't
- **Testable:** design for security, unit, functional, and load testing
- **Consumable:** simple and intuitive interfaces into our systems
- **Verified:** nothing reaches production without validation

### Business

- **Fast:** responsive systems, short time to market, rapid updates and fixes
- **Serviceable:** solutions exist to serve identified needs, not to justify themselves
- **Evolvable:** the business can adapt, grow, and create products and services as needs change
- **Flexible:** customers are served by products and services that fit their varied needs
- **Observable:** clear, real-time visibility into product and service performance
- **Compliant:** meet regulatory, legal, and industry requirements
- **Cost-conscious:** optimize cost across building, operating, and scaling products and services

<!-- §cost-levers -->

### Cost levers

Per-task token tracking and budget ceilings require a runtime governance does not have — that work belongs to the AI platform. Governance contributes by offering cost-aware patterns the user can opt into. The current levers: the [Lightweight Track](#lightweight-track) skips the plan phase for small features; the optional `[simple]` marker on tasks signals to the agent (and the user) that a trivial task should be routed to a cheaper model per the adopter's platform mapping; the stuck-detection step in `/{project}:implement` catches runaway loops before they compound spend; default-off autonomy keeps the human in the loop unless `--auto` is explicitly passed. For runtime cost controls, point the adopter at the platform's tooling — Claude Code's `/cost`, the Anthropic usage dashboard, Cursor's request limits, and equivalents.

<!-- §pipeline -->

## Development Pipeline

Every feature follows the pipeline: **spec → plan → tasks → implement**. No code is written without a spec. No implementation begins without a plan.

<!-- §spec-phase -->

### Spec Phase

Define *what* the feature does and *why*. A spec captures requirements, contracts, and constraints without prescribing implementation details.

Each feature lives in a numbered directory under `specs/`:

```text
specs/
  system.md              # Architecture, shared conventions
  events.md              # Global event catalog
  errors.md              # Error handling conventions
  {NNN-feature}/
    spec.md              # Requirements, contracts, acceptance criteria
    research.md          # (optional) Background research, prior art
    plan.md              # Implementation approach, technical decisions
    data-model.md        # (optional) Domain entities and data structures, generated during plan phase
    tasks.md             # Discrete work items derived from the plan
    scenarios/           # (optional) Scenario files elaborating spec sections
      {slug}.md          # One file per scenario
```

<!-- §spec-requirements -->

#### Spec requirements

- Every spec includes a **Status** indicator: `draft`, `clarified`, `planned`, `in-progress`, or `done`
- Every spec includes **Acceptance Criteria** — concrete, testable conditions that define "done"
- Every spec includes **Open Questions** — uncertainties and unresolved decisions
- Every spec lists **Dependencies** — other specs this feature depends on
- Open questions must be resolved before moving to the plan phase
- Specs describe behavior and contracts, not implementation

<!-- §spec-lifecycle -->

#### Spec lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `draft` | Initial spec written, may have unresolved open questions |
| `clarified` | All open questions resolved, acceptance criteria are concrete and testable |
| `planned` | Plan and tasks exist, readiness check passed |
| `in-progress` | Implementation has started |
| `done` | All acceptance criteria verified, code merged |

```text
draft ──/clarify──▶ clarified ──/plan──▶ planned ──/implement──▶ in-progress ──/implement──▶ done
```

Forward edges only — `/clarify` raises status to `clarified`, `/plan` to `planned`, `/implement` to `in-progress` and then to `done`. Two back-edges exist:

- **Backward via new questions** — `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` → `draft` when `/ask` records a new open question; the next `/clarify` resolves the question and the spec advances forward again. `draft` is the only status that tolerates open questions, so it is the destination; `/ask` performs the status mutation in the same write that records the question.
- **Backward via new scenario** — `done` → `in-progress` when `/elaborate` adds a scenario. The scenario's task is implemented and the spec returns to `done`.

This avoids spec proliferation; scenarios evolve the existing spec rather than spawning a new one.

#### The three cycles

Every spec moves through one of three cycles depending on where it starts and whether new behavior surfaces:

1. **Greenfield** — `/specify` → `/clarify` → `/plan` → `/implement` → `done`. A new feature designed from scratch.
2. **Brownfield** — `/capture` (sketch spec) → real work touches the area → `/elaborate` to add a scenario, or `/clarify` to resolve open questions, or both → `/implement` → `done`. Existing reality being absorbed into specs incrementally.
3. **Reopen** — a `done` spec is revisited because a bug, edge case, or change request surfaces. `/elaborate` adds a scenario, the spec moves back to `in-progress`, and the next pipeline command resumes from there.

All three converge on the same pipeline; what differs is where the spec enters and how precision accumulates.

<!-- §plan-phase -->

### Plan Phase

Define *how* the feature will be implemented. A plan makes technical decisions, identifies affected files, and considers trade-offs.

#### Plan requirements

- References the spec it implements
- Lists technical decisions and their rationale
- Identifies affected files and packages
- Addresses all open questions from the spec
- Produces a data model if the feature introduces or modifies domain entities or data structures

<!-- §tasks-phase -->

### Tasks Phase

Break the plan into discrete, ordered work items. Each task is small enough to implement and verify independently.

#### Task requirements

- Tasks are derived from the plan, not invented independently
- Each task has a clear definition of done
- Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies
- A task can be completed in a single working session

<!-- §readiness-check -->

### Readiness Check

Before implementation begins, verify the feature is ready to build. This is a quick pass/fail gate, not a ceremony.

- [ ] Spec status is `planned`
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are concrete and testable — no empty placeholders
- [ ] All open questions are resolved
- [ ] Data model exists if the feature introduces or modifies domain entities or data structures
- [ ] Plan does not conflict with `system.md` or other feature specs
- [ ] Tasks are ordered and each has a clear definition of done

If any item fails, fix the gap before writing code.

<!-- §implement-phase -->

### Implement Phase

Write code, tests, and migrations. Implementation follows the tasks list.

#### Implementation requirements

- Code matches the contracts defined in the spec
- Tests verify the acceptance criteria
- No work happens outside the tasks list — if new work is discovered, add it as a task first
- Refactoring that preserves existing behavior and contracts does not require a spec or scenario update. If a refactor reveals a missing requirement or changes documented behavior, update the spec or add a scenario to capture the new expectation before proceeding.

<!-- §constants -->

#### Constants and configuration

Values that an operator or deployer might need to tune — such as timeouts, retry counts, batch sizes, thresholds, and rate limits — must never appear as bare literals in the code.

- **Configurable values** — any value that determines system behavior (expiry times, retry counts, batch sizes, thresholds, rate limits, etc.) must be backed by an environment variable, following the rules in the section below.
- **Configurable ranges** — when a configurable value has meaningful bounds (e.g., minimum retries and maximum retries), expose each bound as its own environment variable so operators can tune them without code changes.
- **Fixed constants** — values that are fixed by design and never change across deployments (protocol versions, well-known header names, media types, format strings) must be named constants, not bare literals repeated across the codebase.

Ordinary literals used for local logic — loop indices, string formatting within a function, intermediate calculations — do not need to be extracted.

Organize constants into two tiers:

- **Shared constants** — values used across multiple modules live in a centralized location (e.g., `shared/constants/`). This makes cross-cutting defaults easy to find and audit.
- **Module-local constants** — values used only within a single module live in that module's own constants file. This keeps the module self-contained and avoids coupling unrelated modules through a shared import.

<!-- §env-vars -->

#### Environment variables

When a feature introduces environment variables, follow these rules:

- **`.env.example`** — add every new variable with a descriptive comment and a safe placeholder value. This file is the single source of truth for what the application expects.
- **Defaults** — every environment variable must have a default fallback defined as a named constant. Never scatter bare literals across the codebase. Read the variable once at startup and fall back to the constant when unset.
- **Validation** — validate that every required environment variable resolves to a usable value (either from the environment or its default) at startup. Fail fast with a clear error message naming any variable that cannot be resolved.
- **Time values** — include the unit in the variable name (`_MS`, `_SECONDS`, `_MINUTES`). The corresponding constant must also make the unit explicit (e.g., `DEFAULT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30`).

<!-- §lightweight-track -->

### Lightweight Track

Not every feature needs the full pipeline. Small, well-understood changes with no open questions and no cross-module impact can use a combined `spec-and-plan.md` that merges the spec and plan phases into a single document, then move directly to tasks.

Use the lightweight track when **all** of the following are true:

- The feature touches a single module or package
- There are no open questions — the approach is obvious
- The data model change is trivial or nonexistent
- The spec fits in under 50 lines

If any of these conditions are not met, use the full pipeline.

<!-- §bug-handling -->

## Bug Handling

Bugs are unwritten scenarios. Rather than tracking defects in a separate system, every bug is evidence that a spec is missing, ambiguous, or violated.

### Bug Decision Tree

When a bug is reported, follow this decision tree in order:

1. **No spec exists for the behavior** — the bug is a gap. Write the spec first, then fix the code.
2. **Spec exists but is ambiguous or incomplete** — the bug is a spec deficiency. Correct or enhance the spec, then fix the implementation.
3. **Spec is clear but implementation is wrong** — add a scenario capturing the correct behavior, then fix the code.

In all three cases, the spec becomes more precise. The scenario or spec update is the primary artifact, not a bug report.

<!-- §scenarios -->

### Scenarios

A scenario is a spec at a lower level of abstraction — same format, same discipline, narrower scope. Scenarios live in a `scenarios/` subdirectory alongside the spec they elaborate.

Each scenario file contains:

- **spec-ref** — a reference to the parent spec and section the scenario elaborates
- **Context** — the specific situation or precondition
- **Behavior** — what the system does in that situation
- **Edge Cases** — boundary conditions and exceptions (optional)

Scenarios use plain language. Given/When/Then syntax is not required.

#### Scenario lifecycle

Scenarios do not have their own status field. A scenario is either written (merged) or not. When a scenario is created, a task is appended to the parent spec's `tasks.md` referencing the scenario. The task carries the completion status — the scenario itself is a permanent requirement document.

- The parent spec's status remains `in-progress` while scenario tasks are being worked
- When the task is complete, the scenario stays as documentation of the expected behavior
- If a scenario becomes obsolete, it is deleted — not marked with a status

#### When to create a scenario

- A bug surfaces that the spec covers at a high level but does not describe in sufficient detail
- An edge case is discovered during implementation or review
- A spec section is growing too large and needs to be decomposed

#### When a scenario is not needed

- The spec itself was missing or ambiguous — fix the spec directly
- The behavior is already captured by an existing scenario — update the existing file

<!-- §scenario-promotion -->

#### Scenario promotion

In brownfield projects, scenarios serve a dual purpose: they elaborate edge cases (as in greenfield) and they decompose broad features into distinct workflows. When a scenario grows complex enough, it signals that the behavior warrants its own feature spec.

Indicators that a scenario should be promoted:

- The scenario has more than three edge cases
- The scenario's behavior section is longer than the parent spec's
- The scenario has open questions unrelated to the parent spec's domain
- Multiple scenarios in the same feature share overlapping concerns that would be better unified in their own spec

To promote: the user runs `/specify` (for new behavior) or `/capture` (for another existing feature) to create the new spec, then replaces the original scenario with a dependency reference in the parent spec.

Promotion is a user decision, not automated. The framework provides the pattern; the user recognizes when decomposition is needed.

<!-- §brownfield-inbox -->

### Brownfield Inbox

For projects adopting governance incrementally, a `specs/inbox.md` file serves as a temporary inbox for known issues not yet assigned to a feature spec. Items are recorded with `/log` and groomed into their proper home with `/groom`.

Inbox rules:

- Do not frontfill bugs that are not being actively worked on
- Write specs for areas being actively touched — let adoption spread naturally
- As specs are written, `/groom` migrates items from the inbox into their proper home
- The goal is for `inbox.md` to eventually be empty and deleted

<!-- §brownfield-process -->

### Brownfield Process

Brownfield projects adopt governance incrementally. The `/capture` command initializes a skeleton spec from freeform user input — no pressure to be comprehensive. Start broad; decompose through scenarios over time.

#### Capture → incremental growth → promotion

1. **Capture** — the user describes an existing feature in their own words. `/capture` drafts a skeleton spec at `draft` status with whatever behavior is known. Sparse acceptance criteria are expected and valid.
2. **Incremental growth** — every subsequent touch on the feature adds precision:
   - A **bug fix** reveals missing behavior → adds an acceptance criterion or scenario
   - An **enhancement** adds new behavior → follows the normal pipeline (spec change before implementation)
   - A **clarification** resolves an open question → narrows ambiguity
3. **Promotion** — when a scenario outgrows its parent spec, the user promotes it to its own feature spec (see [Scenario promotion](#scenario-promotion))

Over time the spec converges on a complete description of the feature — not from a documentation effort, but as a side effect of doing work.

#### Inbox integration

When a `/groom` pass encounters an item that does not map to any existing spec, `/groom` directs the user to run `/capture` to initialize a spec first, then return to process the item. The commands stay decoupled — `/log` records, `/groom` routes, `/capture` creates specs.

<!-- §text-first-artifacts -->

## Text-First Artifacts

Governance treats every artifact — constitution, specs, plans, tasks, scenarios, rules — as plain markdown the agent can edit with `Edit`. This is load-bearing: the agent's write path stays simple, PRs review glanceably, merge conflicts stay rare and human-resolvable, and adopting governance requires no bootstrap tooling beyond the AI agent itself.

### Principles

- All governance artifacts are markdown by default. The agent reads and writes them with the same `Edit` flow used for code.
- Structured metadata lives in YAML frontmatter at the top of each markdown file; the document body remains markdown prose.
- Cross-artifact references use standard relative markdown links (`[label](../path.md)`), not wiki-links — this keeps PRs reviewable on GitHub and viewers like Quartz/Obsidian still resolve them.
- Source-of-truth artifacts are markdown. Structured derived views are regenerated from canonical sources and never become the canonical record.
- **Non-markdown derived views** (SQLite caches, JSON indexes, generated graph data, binary artifacts) MUST be gitignored and regenerated on demand by their consumers.
- **Markdown derived views** (e.g., a per-spec `code-locations.md`) MAY be committed when their diffs are valuable to humans — for PR review, onboarding, refactoring impact analysis, or session-resumption context for the agent. Adopters MAY gitignore a particular markdown derived view if they prefer; commit is permitted, not required.
- Exceptions to text-first source-of-truth require an explicit constitutional amendment with stated rationale.

### Frontmatter Schema

The frontmatter schema applies to **spec files** (`spec.md`, `spec-and-plan.md`) and **scenario files** (`scenarios/{slug}.md`). Other governance artifacts (`system.md`, `errors.md`, `events.md`, `inbox.md`, plan files, tasks files, rule files, README files) MAY include frontmatter when a specific consumer benefits, but are not required to.

#### Spec files

| Field | Required | Type | Allowed values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | yes | string | `draft`, `clarified`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `done` | Spec lifecycle state |
| `dependencies` | yes | list of strings | spec slugs (e.g., `002-events`); empty list permitted | Specs this feature depends on |
| `tags` | no | list of strings | free-form; see starter vocabulary below | Cross-cutting categories used by graph-view consumers |

#### Scenario files

| Field | Required | Type | Allowed values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec-ref` | yes | string | parent spec ref, conventionally `"{NNN-feature-name} — {Section}"` (quoted because the value commonly contains an em-dash and slash) | Identifies the parent spec and section the scenario elaborates |
| `tags` | no | list of strings | free-form | Scenario-level cross-cutting tags |

#### Open-schema rule

Additional fields beyond those listed above are permitted and ignored by uninterested consumers. Examples adopters or future governance work might add: `owner`, `target_release`, `created_at`, `description`, `aliases`. The `spec-and-plan.md` template uses the open-schema rule to carry `track: lightweight` — a human-readable marker, not a pipeline-consumed field. Consumers MUST NOT error on the presence of unknown fields. `/gov:validate` reports unknown fields as informational findings (not errors).

### Validation Severity

`/gov:validate` checks frontmatter against this schema with the following severity:

- **Hard fail** — frontmatter block missing on a spec or scenario file; frontmatter YAML malformed; `status` missing or not in the allowed set; `dependencies` missing or not a list; `spec-ref` missing on a scenario.
- **Advisory** — `tags` missing or empty; existing checkbox/cross-reference checks.
- **Informational** — unknown fields present.

Hard fails block the validation pass. Advisory and informational findings are reported but do not block.

For non-frontmatter checks (spec integrity, artifact completeness, plan/task consistency, dependencies, security rules), `/gov:validate` adds a fourth tier — **Blocking** — between Hard fail and Advisory. Blocking findings are structural or content issues that must be fixed before the next pipeline gate fires (e.g., missing `plan.md` on a `planned` spec, an unknown rule ID referenced in a spec). Hard fail and Blocking both prevent pipeline advancement; the distinction is that Hard fail says "the spec file itself is malformed," while Blocking says "the artifact set is incomplete or inconsistent." See `framework/commands/validate.md` for the full per-check severity assignment.

### Starter Tag Vocabulary

Published as guidance, not enforcement. Adopters and future specs MAY introduce new tags as needed; `/gov:specify` surfaces existing tags from sibling specs as autocomplete to drive convergence by reuse rather than ceremony.

| Tag | Suggested use |
| --- | --- |
| `cli` | Specs about slash commands or command-line interactions |
| `commands` | Specs that introduce, rename, or significantly change slash commands |
| `bootstrap` | Specs about adopting governance, project scaffolding, or initialization |
| `process` | Specs about workflow, lifecycle, or pipeline behavior |
| `templates` | Specs about template files (spec, plan, scenario, project-readme, etc.) |
| `security` | Specs about security rules, authentication, authorization |
| `agent` | Specs about AI-agent behavior, capabilities, or coordination |
| `format` | Specs about artifact formats, schemas, or serialization conventions |
| `pipeline` | Specs about the spec → plan → tasks → implement flow |
| `migration` | Specs that convert existing artifacts to a new format or convention |
| `scenarios` | Specs about scenario semantics, scenario targeting, or scenario tooling |
| `brownfield` | Specs about brownfield adoption, capture, inbox grooming, or incremental spec growth |

<!-- §drift-prevention -->

## Drift Prevention

These principles keep facts consistent as the framework evolves. They apply both to governance itself and to projects that adopt it. Drift is a class of bug; preventing it is part of the framework's design, not an afterthought.

### Canonical sources

For every kind of fact described in multiple places, one location is authoritative. Other documents that describe the fact MUST reference the canonical source rather than restate it.

| Fact | Canonical source |
| --- | --- |
| Spec lifecycle states and back-edges | `framework/constitution.md` §spec-lifecycle |
| Pipeline command behavior | each command's source under `framework/commands/*.md` (or `framework/bootstrap/configure/{key}.md`) |
| Frontmatter schema for specs and scenarios | `framework/constitution.md` §text-first-artifacts |
| Validation severity tiers | `framework/constitution.md` §text-first-artifacts (Validation Severity subsection) |
| Workflow registry | `framework/workflows/registry.json` |
| Per-agent permission set | `framework/bootstrap/configure/{key}.md` |
| Constitution section anchors | `<!-- §<anchor> -->` markers in `framework/constitution.md` |
| Command frontmatter (description, argument-hint) | each command's own frontmatter block |

When adding a new kind of fact that may be referenced from multiple documents, name its canonical source explicitly here.

### Cross-document references

When document B describes content authored in document A, B includes a back-link to A — relative markdown link, anchor reference (`§anchor`), or section name. Two consequences follow:

- Changing A includes auditing every back-link to A. The audit is structured wherever it can be machine-checked (anchor resolution, help-table descriptions, registry-frontmatter equivalence), and a manual sweep otherwise.
- Adding a fact that conceptually belongs in A but landing it in B is drift. Either move the fact to A and back-link, or extend A's scope explicitly.

### Template-rule alignment

Every blocking check in `/{project}:validate` has a corresponding scaffolding element in the template that produces a passing artifact by default. The contract runs in both directions:

- Adding a new blocking check requires a template update so a freshly-copied artifact passes the check without manual editing.
- Adding template structure requires a corresponding rule (validate check, constitution rule, or both). Sections that don't trace back to a rule are dead weight.

Templates and validate evolve together. A diff that touches one without the other is incomplete.

### Manifest discipline

When multiple commands distribute or reference the same set of files (e.g., `/govern` and `/{project}:init` both scaffold a project; `/{project}:configure` and the bootstrap install both apply permission sets), the file list lives in one place:

- Either as a shared section the commands include by reference, or
- As a registry both commands read.

Two commands that copy-paste the same manifest into their own bodies are guaranteed to drift over time. Consolidate or accept that drift is the rule, not the exception.

### Done specs are frozen archaeology

`done` specs reflect the world at merge time. The framework will continue to evolve; done specs will not be rewritten to match. Drift between a done spec's body and the current framework is expected — handle it with **signposts at the top of the spec**, not by rewriting the body. Plan and tasks files in done-spec directories follow the same rule.

A signpost names what changed and points readers at the current source of truth. It does not edit history.

<!-- §pipeline-boundaries -->

## Pipeline Boundaries

- Never implement without a spec
- Never plan without resolving open questions
- Never skip phases — each phase produces artifacts the next phase consumes
- Never transition a spec to the next status without explicit user approval — present the work done and wait for the user to confirm before updating the status field
- Specs and plans are living documents — update them when decisions change, but don't backtrack silently

<!-- §concurrent-features -->

### Concurrent Features

The session state file (`{cli-config-dir}/{project}-session.json`) holds a single target by design. The pipeline is serial within a feature, and concurrent work on independent features uses two independent sessions in two terminals — not multi-target session state. Isolation is provided by the platform layer: `git worktree` keeps the working trees separate, and AI-agent platforms typically expose isolation primitives (Claude Code's `isolation: "worktree"` agent parameter, Cursor's worktree integration, etc.). Reach for those rather than asking governance to track multiple targets at once.

<!-- §cross-spec-impact -->

### Cross-Spec Impact

Specs are self-contained. When work on one spec identifies changes that affect another spec, those changes are recorded in the affected spec — not left as a note in the originating spec. The affected spec is the source of truth for its own behavior.

This applies when:

- A feature renames or supersedes an artifact from a prior spec
- Work on spec A reveals that spec B needs a new acceptance criterion or scenario
- A scenario in spec A exposes an edge case that belongs to spec B
- An implementation decision in spec A's plan creates a constraint for spec B

In each case:

- The change is recorded in the affected spec as a new acceptance criterion, scenario, or signpost note
- The signpost references the originating spec so the reader understands why the change was made
- If the affected spec is `done`, adding the change reopens it to `in-progress` per the normal lifecycle

The originating spec's acceptance criteria include delivering the cross-spec update. This ensures the change is tracked as part of the work that discovered it.

<!-- §numbering -->

## Numbering Convention

Feature directories use three-digit zero-padded numbers: `000-skeleton`, `001-observability`, `002-events`. Numbers establish creation order and suggest a natural implementation sequence, but dependencies between features determine the actual build order.

<!-- §markdown-standards -->

## Markdown Standards

All `.md` files must pass `npx markdownlint-cli2` using the project config in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`.

Key rules:

- Every fenced code block must specify a language — **MD040**
- Files must start with a top-level heading — **MD041**
- No trailing spaces or missing blank lines around headings, lists, and fenced code blocks
- ATX-style headings only (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Heading levels increment by one — **MD001**
- No duplicate headings at the same level within the same parent — **MD024** (siblings\_only)
- Link fragments must reference valid heading anchors — **MD051**
- Ordered lists use sequential numbering — **MD029**
- Tables use compact style: `| text |` — **MD060**
- Line length is not enforced (MD013 disabled)
- Inline HTML is allowed (MD033 disabled)
