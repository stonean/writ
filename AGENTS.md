# Project: writ

Opinionated Go web framework with a declarative DSL for HTTP request pipelines

## Constitution

See [constitution.md](constitution.md) — guiding principles, development pipeline, spec lifecycle, and quality standards that govern this project.

## Tech Stack

<!-- Define your project's tech stack here. Example:

| Layer | Technology | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language** | Go v1.26.0 | Application logic |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL v18 | Primary data store |

-->

## Commands

<!-- Define your project's common commands. Example:

- Dev: `make dev`
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`

-->

## Project Structure

- `constitution.md` -- Principles, pipeline, quality standards
- `AGENTS.md` -- Agent rules: tech stack, conventions, boundaries
- `CLAUDE.md` -- `@AGENTS.md` + Claude Code-specific configuration
- `specs/`
  - `system.md` -- Architecture, shared conventions
  - `events.md` -- Global event catalog
  - `errors.md` -- Error handling conventions and codes
  - `inbox.md` -- Temporary inbox for known issues not yet assigned to a spec
  - `templates/` -- Starter files for specs, plans, tasks, scenarios
  - `{NNN-feature}/`
    - `spec.md` -- Requirements, contracts, acceptance criteria
    - `research.md` -- *(optional)* Background research, prior art, context
    - `plan.md` -- Implementation approach, technical decisions
    - `data-model.md` -- *(optional)* Generated during plan phase
    - `tasks.md` -- Discrete work items derived from the plan
    - `scenarios/` -- Bug fixes, edge cases, detailed behavior elaborations
      - `{slug}.md` -- Individual scenario created via the scenario command

<!-- Add project-specific directories below (e.g., src/, cmd/, modules/) -->

## Code Style

<!-- Define code patterns and conventions specific to your tech stack. -->

## Testing

<!-- Define testing conventions, test types, and file placement. -->

## Gotchas

<!-- Document things agents consistently get wrong — framework quirks, version-specific behavior,
     and non-obvious conventions that waste cycles. Focus on what's surprising, not what's standard.
     Example:

- pgx v5 uses `pgx.RowToStructByName`, not the older `Scan` pattern
- templ components must not import `net/http` — pass values through parameters
- `air` does not watch `.sql` files by default — add the pattern to `.air.toml`
- NATS JetStream consumer names must be globally unique, not just per-stream

-->

## Boundaries

- Before working on any spec beyond its spec.md, verify all dependency specs have status `done`. If any dependency is not done, work on the earliest incomplete dependency instead.
- Follow tasks.md literally — do not skip ahead to later pipeline phases. When tasks say to set status to `planned`, stop there. The user advances to the next phase explicitly.

<!-- Define additional project-specific boundaries. Common patterns:

- Never implement without a spec — follow the pipeline: spec → plan → tasks → implement
- Never commit secrets or .env files
- Never modify CI/CD config without asking
- Ask before adding new dependencies
- Ask before changing database schema
